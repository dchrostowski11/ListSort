# ListSort
Takes two lists and compares them, giving the user the option of choosing if it returns matching or missing elements from both lists.

The purpose of this small project was to quicken the process of having to do a search among two lists.  Rather than doing it by brute force, like I had to do at my job, I chose to create this to speed up the process.  It made the process go from taking a few hours to a matter of seconds.
